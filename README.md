## image semantic segmentation package

A image semantic segmentation toolbox (single GPU) contains some common semantic segmentation algorithms. The code is implemented by Pytorch.

### Requires

  1. pytorch >= 1.0.0
  2. python 3.x
  
### Usage

```
 python train.py --option1 value1 --option2 value2 ...
 For the list of options, please see train.py
```

### Performance

#### PSPNet(ResNet50)

| ADE20K    |   pixAcc    |    mIoU    |
| -------- | -------:  | :------: |
| [paper](https://github.com/hszhao/PSPNet) [1]  |    80.04   |   41.68  |
| this code(without background)  |    77.1   |   38.6   |
| this code(with background)  |    72.19   |   35.3   |

##### Discussion and details:
```
 epoch: 30(here) / 120(paper)
 learning rate scheduler: poly
 batch size: 12(here) / 16(paper)
 image size: 384(here) / 473(paper)
 nbr_classes: 150(without background, standard ade20k) / 151 (with background)
```
  In the original paper, authors run their experiments on the standard ADE20k(150 classes, without background). 
  But I regard the background (i.e. labeled 0 in the original mask) as a category and the output dimensionality of the PSPNet is 151 in my code.
  Therefore, the performance gap mainly comes from three aspectsï¼š
  1) I add the background class to the dataset, which may lead to category imbalance problems and increases the complexity of the model.
  2) Due to limited video memory on a single GPU, I set the batch_size to 12 and image_size to 384 instead of 16 and 473 in the original paper. 
  3) In addition, the experiments in the original paper used multiple GPUs, which means a larger batch_size can be set to make Synchronization Batch Normalization layers more effective.
  
#### EncNet(ResNet50)

| ADE20K    |   pixAcc    |    mIoU    |
| -------- | -------:  | :------: |
| [paper](https://github.com/zhanghang1989/PyTorch-Encoding) [2]  |    79.73   |   41.11  |
| this code(without background)  |    76.7   |   37.3   |
```
 epoch: 30 (here) / 120 (paper)
 learning rate scheduler: poly
 batch size: 8 (here) / 16 (paper)
 image size: 400 (here) / 480 (paper)
 nbr_classes: 150(without background, standard ade20k)
```
